## Synthesizer Project
Playing around with DAC (communicatoin via spi) to create nice sounds.
Implementation of Sin wave generater and saw generator

In the future:
- Own DAC
- SOme filter to create crazy sounds
- maybe add a keyboard or something


### dac_12bit_spi.v
- communication to MCP4921 D/A chip
- Implementation seems to work(at least with the multimeter the currency values are right)
